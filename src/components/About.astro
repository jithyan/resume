      I've been a software developer for around {numYears} years, and I've spent
      the last {numYears - 1} years primarily building React SPAs at ANZ, IAG and
      NAB.

      I'm interested in any coding heavy roles in both the backend and frontend,
      that require deep knowledge in React or Typescript. I'm also keen on
      learning different languages such as Rust, Scala or Go.
