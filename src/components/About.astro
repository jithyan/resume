  <p class="pl-1 mb-2">
    I've been a software developer for around {numYears} years. I got my start at
    a consultancy called CGI working mainly on ETLs and reporting using Microsoft
    SQL Server. Since then, I've spent the last {numYears - 1} years building React
    SPAs at ANZ, IAG and NAB.

  <p class="pl-1">
    I'm interested in any challenging roles in both the backend and frontend,
    that require deep knowledge in React or Typescript. I'm also keen on
    learning new languages such as Rust, Scala or Go.
