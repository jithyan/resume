  <p class="pl-1 mb-1.5">
    I've been a software developer for around {numYears} years. I got my start at
    a consultancy working mainly on ETLs and reporting using Microsoft SQL Server
    for about a year. Since then, I've spent the last {numYears - 1} years building
    React SPAs at ANZ, IAG and NAB.

  <p class="pl-1">
    I'm interested in any challenging roles in both the backend and frontend,
    that require deep knowledge in React or Typescript. I'm also for keen on
    learning new languages such as Rust or Go.
