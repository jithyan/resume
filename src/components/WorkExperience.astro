                When brokers leave an organization, tickets are created in
                ServiceNow to remove them from the system. This involves
                deleting them from MongoDB and closing the tickets, which would
                be quite a time consuming process, given on a bad day, up to 50
                brokers could need to be removed.

                Wrote a script to interact with the ServiceNow APIs to extract
                broker's ID from the ticket, delete it from our Mongo database
                and close the ticket. This ran as a nightly job.
