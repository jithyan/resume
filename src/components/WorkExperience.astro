        <ul>
          <li>
            When brokers leave an organization, tickets are created in
            ServiceNow to remove them from the system. This involves deleting
            them from MongoDB and closing the tickets, which would be quite a
            time consuming process, given on a bad day, up to 50 brokers could
            need to be removed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wrote a script to interact with the ServiceNow APIs to extract
            broker's ID from the ticket, delete it from our Mongo database and
            close the ticket. This ran as a nightly job.
          </li>
          <li>
            Resulted in significant cost savings, as my team members no longer
            needed to service those tickets.
